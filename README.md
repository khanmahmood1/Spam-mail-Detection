Welcome to the Spam-mail-Detection project!

## About
The SpamHam Classifier is a simple machine learning project that categorizes emails as either spam (üö´) or ham (‚úâÔ∏è). It uses the power of TF-IDF and logistic regression to make predictions.

## How it Works
The classifier analyzes email content using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract important features. Then, it uses logistic regression to classify emails as spam or ham based on these features.
